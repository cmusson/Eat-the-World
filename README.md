# Eat-the-World
App detailing the different foods of the world.

Where users can search and select or randomly generate any country, listing the country's national dishes, recipes for each dish and places nearby that the user can buy the food.

Made mobile first, as a pwa.

To run the project :
- Make sure to run npm i in both the client and the server folder to install required dependencies.
- In the server folder, run node index.js and the server will run on port 3001.
- In the client folder, you will need to create a .env file to host the Google Maps API: REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=yourkey
    - no API key required for wikipedia 

- Map at beginnning is generated using react-leaflet.
- Map at the back is using Google Maps API.

- Hope you enjoy the app, any feedback/PR is appreciated !
